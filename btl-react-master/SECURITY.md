Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

If you discover a security vulnerability within our project, please follow these steps:

1. **Reporting:** Send a security vulnerability report to [datpham0136@gmail.com](mailto:datpham0136@gmail.com.com). Please refrain from creating public issues until we have had a chance to verify and address the vulnerability.

2. **Feedback:** You will receive feedback as soon as possible, no later than 48 hours (2 business days).

3. **Vulnerability Verification:** We will verify and confirm the security vulnerability within 7 business days.

4. **Security Patch and Release:** After confirming the vulnerability, we will develop and deploy a security patch as soon as possible.

5. **Community Notification:** Once the patch is ready, we will publicly announce and disclose detailed information about the security vulnerability unless otherwise agreed upon.
